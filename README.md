# GitHub MCP Client

GitHub MCP Client is a command-line chatbot that lets you interact with GitHub using natural language using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). It launches the [GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) in Docker and connects to an OpenAI-compatible LLM.

## üîß Prerequisites

- Python ‚â• 3.10
- Docker
- OpenAI compatible API key (e.g. Together, Fireworks, Groq, OpenAI)

## üöÄ Quick start

```bash
# clone & enter repo
git clone https://github.com/jpreagan/github-mcp-client.git
cd github-mcp-client

# optional: create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# install deps (pip or uv)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a file called **.env**:

```dotenv
LLM_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Then run:

```bash
python main.py
```

## üß™ Example sessions

Let's start with a warmpup, which requires only a single tool call:

```
GitHub MCP Server running on stdio
>>> List five interesting facts about me on GitHub.
2025-05-16 17:25:53,392 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.together.xyz/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-05-16 17:25:53,399 - INFO - üîß Calling tool: get_me with params: {}
2025-05-16 17:25:53,848 - INFO - ‚úÖ Tool 'get_me' executed successfully
2025-05-16 17:25:58,815 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.together.xyz/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Sure, here are five interesting facts about you on GitHub:

1. **Username and Profile**: Your GitHub username is `jpreagan`, and you have a profile picture that represents you. You can be found at [this link](https://github.com/jpreagan).

2. **Location and Interests**: You are located in Hilo, Hawaii, and your bio mentions that you are an AI engineer who loves 80's music and udon noodles. You also have a personal website at [jpreagan.com](https://jpreagan.com/).

3. **Repositories and Gists**: You have 5 public repositories and no public gists. Additionally, you have 1 private repository.

4. **Followers and Following**: You have 20 followers and are following 1 person.

5. **Account History**: Your GitHub account was created on December 27, 2018, and it was last updated on May 16, 2025. You have two-factor authentication enabled, which enhances the security of your account.
```

Now let's try a query that requires multiple tool calls using dynamic toolsets:

```
